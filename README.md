# pingpong-robot
这是一个学习强化学习的项目。基于PyGame+Box2D模拟二维平面上的乒乓球场地，使用PPO相关算法，训练单个智能体接球、连续击打，未来将训练两个智能体发球、对打。球拍运动方式，开始仅是简单的两个自由度运动，后面将模拟机械臂多关节运动。

This is a project on learning reinforcement learning. Based on PyGame+Box2D, it simulates a ping pong court on a two-dimensional plane. Using PPO-related algorithms, it trains a single agent to receive the ball and hit it continuously. In the future, it will train two agents to serve and play against each other. The movement of the racket starts with simple two degrees of freedom, and later it will simulate multi-joint movements of a robotic arm.
